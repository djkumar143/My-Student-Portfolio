        <div class="content-desc">
            <p>JavaScript library ReactJS is used to create interactive elements for websites using JavaScript. </p>
            <p>JS libraries provide prewritten JavaScript code you can use for common JS tasks, relieving you of the
                time-consuming (and unnecessary) task of writing the code yourself. </p><br/>
                <div class="image">
                    <img src="/blogImages/react/react-1.jpg" width="800px" alt="react-1">
                </div>
            <p>Now,let's get back to React.. In addition to the many different JS libraries out there, React JS is also
                one of them - but what makes it unique? What is React JS used for? And why should you learn React JS?
                And is it better than other JavaScript libraries? There are many questions like these which may be
                coming into your mind.and its ok to have such sort of questions if you are willing to work with it. </p>
            <br />
            <h2>Why do Javascript developers use React JS</h2>
            <p>This JavaScript library helps developers build user interfaces, or UIs, for websites and web
                applications. In other words, UIs are the menus, search bars, buttons, and anything else people interact
                with to USE a website or app.</p><br/>
            <p>But wait.. You may also be asking at this point that weather the React JS library is Frontend or Backend
                ? And the simple answer to this is: Front end. This is used exclusively for UI building or you can say
                for client side. both mean the same. Here is an example of my website which I created using React </p>
                <div class="image">
                    <img src="/blogImages/react/react-2.PNG" width="800px" alt="react-2">
                    <img src="/blogImages/react/react-3.PNG" width="800px" alt="react-3">
                </div>
            <p>Now , the most Important thing is: the heart of any website. At the heart of any basic website are HTML
                documents. Web browsers read these documents and display them on your computer, tablet, or phone as web
                pages. During this process, browsers create something called a Document Object Model (DOM), a
                representational tree of how the web page is arranged. Developers can then add dynamic content to their
                projects by modifying the DOM with languages like JavaScript.</p><br/>
            <p>JSX stands for Javascript extentions and React JS extensions make it easy for web developers to modify an
                application's DOM with simple, HTML-style code. And, since all modern web browsers support React JS, JSX
                can be used on any browser platform.</p>
