            <h2>Why React? What is React? Should I learn it?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="content-desc">
            <p>JavaScript library ReactJS is used to create interactive elements for websites using JavaScript. </p>
            <p>JS libraries provide prewritten JavaScript code you can use for common JS tasks, relieving you of the
                time-consuming (and unnecessary) task of writing the code yourself. </p><br/>
                <div class="image">
                    <img src="/blogImages/react/react-1.jpg"  alt="react-1">
                </div>
            <p>Now,let's get back to React.. In addition to the many different JS libraries out there, React JS is also
                one of them - but what makes it unique? What is React JS used for? And why should you learn React JS?
                And is it better than other JavaScript libraries? There are many questions like these which may be
                coming into your mind.and its ok to have such sort of questions if you are willing to work with it. </p>
            <br />
            <h2>Why do Javascript developers use React JS</h2>
            <p>This JavaScript library helps developers build user interfaces, or UIs, for websites and web
                applications. In other words, UIs are the menus, search bars, buttons, and anything else people interact
                with to USE a website or app.</p><br/>
            <p>But wait.. You may also be asking at this point that weather the React JS library is Frontend or Backend
                ? And the simple answer to this is: Front end. This is used exclusively for UI building or you can say
                for client side. both mean the same. Here is an example of my website which I created using React </p>
                <div class="image">
                    <img src="/blogImages/react/react-2.PNG"  alt="react-2">
                    <img src="/blogImages/react/react-3.PNG"  alt="react-3">
                </div>
                <h2>JSX</h2>
            <p>Now , the most Important thing is: the heart of any website. At the heart of any basic website are HTML
                documents. Web browsers read these documents and display them on your computer, tablet, or phone as web
                pages. During this process, browsers create something called a Document Object Model (DOM), a
                representational tree of how the web page is arranged. Developers can then add dynamic content to their
                projects by modifying the DOM with languages like JavaScript.</p><br/>
            <p>JSX stands for Javascript extentions and React JS extensions make it easy for web developers to modify an
                application's DOM with simple, HTML-style code. And, since all modern web browsers support React JS, JSX
                can be used on any browser platform.</p><br/>
                <h2>Virtual DOM</h2>
                <p>This approach enables the declarative API of React: You tell React what state you want the UI to be in, and it makes sure the DOM matches that state. This abstracts out the attribute manipulation, event handling, and manual DOM updating that you would otherwise have to use to build your app.</p>
                <div class="image">
                    <img src="./blogImages/react/react-4.png" alt="react-4">
                </div>
                <p>This kind of selective updating takes less computing power and less loading time, which might not sound like much when you’re talking about a single blog comment, but—when you start to think about all the dynamics and updating associated with even a slightly complex website—you’ll realize it adds up to a lot.</p><br/>
                <h2>Should you use it?</h2>
                <p>You may have built many website and apps using html, css and vanilla javascript and working with them is also easy, but, there are some cons too.</p>
                <p>Those are:-</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It facilitates the overall process of writing components</li>
                    <li>Each Developer writes his/her code differently if working with html, css and vanilla javascript, and if you are working on a big and complex project, then it might be a mess for other peoples to understand those thousands of lines of code and it may reduce the efficiency of your Project.</li>
                    <li>As talked earlier, React is very powerful tool that can help to make really awesome projects and those are fast too.  </li>
                    <li>It is useful for making SPA's (single page application) . Many famous sites and apps like YouTube, Facebook, Linkedin and many other  are built using Teact  </li>
                    <li>If you combine React with Redux , then you will unleash the power to make almost everything that you see.  </li>
                    <li> It ensures faster rendering.</li>
                </ul><br/>
                <h2>Example Projects:</h2>
                <p>there are some of my project links that you can check out if you wanna see what kind of entry level projects can you build with it. Check them out...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><a class="link" href="https://tech-phoenix.netlify.app/" >Project 1</a> </li>
                    <li><a class="link" href="https://deep-movies-app.netlify.app/" >Project 2</a> </li>

                </ul>
                <br/>
                <p>Hope that I was able to answer most of your doubts regarding React . But if still there is some confusion and you want to discuss it with me, then you are free to do so . You can just ping me on social media and i will get back to you.</p>
